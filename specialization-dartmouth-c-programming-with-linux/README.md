Welcome to the **`certification-c-programming-linux-specialization`** repository!.  
This repository contains my study notes, activity solutions, and projects from the **C Programming with Linux Specialization** offered by Dartmouth College and Institut Mines-Télécom on Coursera. The specialization covers the following courses:

1. [**C Programming: Getting Started**](./course-1-getting-started/) ✅ **`100%` 🗓️ `[2025-03-13]`**
2. [**C Programming: Language Foundations**](./course-2-language-foundations/) ✅ **`100%` 🗓️ `[2025-03-20]`**
3. [**C Programming: Modular Programming and Memory Management**](./course-3-modular-programming-memory-management/) ✅ **`100%` 🗓️ `[2025-04-06]`**
4. **C Programming: Pointers and Memory Management**
5. **C Programming: Advanced Data Types**
